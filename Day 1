## Day 1: Introduction to PowerShell
- Explored: PowerShell environment, help system, cmdlet structure
- Cmdlets practiced:
    - `Get-Command`
    - `Get-Help`
    - `Get-Alias`
    - `$PSVersionTable`
- Notes:
    - Cmdlets follow Verb-Noun naming convention.
    - Discovered there are hundreds of built-in commands.
    - Alias like `ls` maps to `Get-ChildItem` (cross-platform compatible).
